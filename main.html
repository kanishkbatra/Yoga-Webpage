	<p>Yoga is not a religion, a cult or a belief system. At the root of yoga is self-inquiry. Everything we do, whether it's a yoga pose, a meditation, a mantra or a breathing technique (pranayama), has the purpose of encouraging us to connect to our bodies and our life experience in a more meaningful way. For example, understanding the balance of effort and release in your yoga practice requires constant attention and sensitivity and has profound meaning in our everyday lives as a meditation on balancing stress and relaxation. Experiencing true relaxation is a deeply rewarding experience. And understanding how to move into extremely challenging poses effortlessly, with a calm mind and steady breath, is invaluable to us all in our busy lives. Yoga is not only about stretching, it's much much more than that!. </p>
		
<p>Yoga's origins come from a deeply-felt drive for self-understanding, physical and emotional release and total wellbeing. It's much more than the physical experience of a yoga pose. It digs deep into the reality of who you are, what you want and why you are here. As you spend more time doing yoga, you will likely dig deeper into the layers that make up who you are as a person. Yoga helps you let go of old patterns, feel more open and happy and connect with friends, family and your world in a more meaningful way</p>
		<ul>There are so many benefits of doing yoga. Yoga helps you to <br><br>
			<li>Improve and maintain the health of muscles, joints and organs</li>
			<li>Get proper relaxed sound sleep</li>
			<li>Keep mind healthy</li>
			<li>Improve performance and prevent injuries in sports</li>
			<li>Speed up recovery from illness</li>
			<li>Prevent from diseases and get quick treatment from diseases like diabetes, heart disease and auto-immune disorders</li>
			<li>Slow down the negative effects of an office job</li>
			<li>Increase your sense of happiness and well being</li>

    <h1>Guidelines For Yoga</h1>
    </div>
    
<div id='gencon'>
<b>When not to practice yoga</b>
<p><i>Please read the contraindications for each posture before doing it. Menstruation, pregnancy, high blood pressure and injuries to the knees, shoulders, and neck are all conditions where certain postures must be avoided and special care must be taken in all postures. If you have any medical condition, you should check with your health care professional before starting a yoga practice.</i></p>

<b>Modify the postures for your body</b>
<p><i>The instructions and pictures of the yoga postures are the “goal,” meaning the direction you are going towards, not where you need to be. Experiment and explore different positions and alignment to make the posture work for your body.</i></p>
	
<b>How to choose postures</b>
<p><i>Choose to practice postures that look like you can do them. Postures done on the floor are going to be easier than standing postures, as they do not require as much strength or balance. Also, postures that have longer recommended hold times (in breaths) are going to be easier to do.
	Use our  yoga posture sequences as a starting point and foundation for your practice sequence.</i></p>

<b>Drinking and eating</b>
<p><i>It is not advisable to eat or drink right before a yoga practice (especially if you are practicing inversions). Eat no less than 1-3 hours before and drink only small amounts of water before practice, and do not drink during your practice if possible.</i></p>

    The Hatha Yoga Pradipika (Light on Hatha Yoga) is a classic fifteenth-century Sanskrit manual on hatha yoga, written by Svāmi Svātmārāma, who connects the teaching's lineage to Matsyendranath of the Nathas. It is among the most influential surviving texts on hatha yoga. The Hatha Yoga Pradipika is also one of three classic texts on hatha yoga, alongside the Gheranda Samhita and the Shiva Samhita.<br>
	In India hatha yoga is associated in popular tradition with the 'jogis' of the Natha Sampradaya through its mythical founder Matsyendranath. Matsyendranath, also known as Minanath or Minapa in Tibet, is celebrated as a saint in both Buddhist and Hindu tantric and hatha yoga schools. However, James Mallinson associates hatha yoga with the Dashanami Sampradaya and the mystical figure of Dattatreya. <br> 
	The Hatha yoga texts place major emphasis on mitahara, which connotes "measured diet" or "moderate eating".

The impact of yoga on physical and mental health has been a topic of systematic studies. Some scholars state that a regular and proper yoga practice yields health benefits. Others state that the results of these studies have been mixed and inconclusive, with cancer studies suggesting none to unclear effectiveness, and others suggesting yoga may reduce risk factors and aid in a patient's psychological healing process. <br>
Yoga's combined focus on mindfulness, breathing, and physical movements bring health benefits with regular participation. Yoga participants report better sleep, increased energy levels and muscle tone, relief from muscle pain and stiffness, improved circulation and overall better general health. The breathing aspect of yoga can benefit heart rate and blood pressure.<br>
The 2012 "Yoga in America" survey, conducted by Harris Interactive on behalf of Yoga Journal, shows that the number of adult practitioners in the US is 20.4 million, or 8.7 percent. The survey reported that 44 percent of those not practicing yoga said they are interested in trying it.
